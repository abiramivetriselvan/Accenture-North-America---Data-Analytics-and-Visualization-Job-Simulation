**Task 1: Project Understanding**

*Collaborated with the Accenture team, including industry, IPO, and data experts, to discuss the new project for the client, Social Buzz.
*Reviewed and analyzed the client project brief to understand the business problem, identify requirements, and prioritize tasks as a data analyst.
Client Requirements:
1.An audit of their big data practice.
2.Recommendations for a successful IPO.
3.An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity.

**Task 2: Data Cleaning & Modeling**

*Identify which datasets will be required to answer the client’s business question.
*Clean the datasets and merge them to prepare the data for analysis.
*Determine the answer to the client’s business question.

The client has sent through:
7 data sets - each data set contains different columns and values.
A data model - this shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.

Used the data model to identify which datasets will be required to answer the business question - to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.

Reaction, Content, Reaction Types are the three data sets we will need to complete our analysis.

Clean the data by:
removing rows that have values which are missing, changing the data type of some values within a column, and removing columns which are not relevant to this task.

To complete data modelling:
1. Created a final data set by merging three tables together using a “VLookUp” formula.
2. Figured out the Top 5 performing categories using the “Sum If” formula.
The end result contains a cleaned dataset and the top 5 categories.

**Task 3: Data Visualization & Storytelling**

*Selected Tableau visualizations that effectively highlight the client’s content performance story.
*Created a PowerPoint presentation incorporating Tableau insights to deliver a comprehensive performance report.

Insights:
*Discovered the total number of unique categories in the dataset.
*Identified the number of reactions for the most popular category.
*Determined the month with the highest number of posts.

**Task 4: Present to the Client**

Recorded a video presentation summarizing key insights and visualizations for the client.
